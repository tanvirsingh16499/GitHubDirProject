1) ide - eclipse
2) jdk 8 
3)

class Emp
{
}
Emp.java 


Q can we define class without mainmethod 

yes but that class will not run it will get compiled

note 
1) in one source code only one public class can be created 
2) public class name= file name 
3) in one source code two or more classes can be created

public class Emp{}
class xyz{}
class abc{}
